A recipe search web page that allows users to enter a recipe they want to follow and they will be shown a list of different recipes they could follow along with the option to narrow down the results with categories within the recipe. This webpage will be compiled using the Django framework that uses Python which is a programming language I am unfamiliar with but I will be using HTML as my frontend which Iâ€™m familiar with and SQLite as my database.
